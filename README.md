# Agile Development Methology:

 - I documented and implemented all User Stories using the Agile Project Management tools on GitHub. 
 - I created a basic kanban board in the projects section of my git-hub repository.
 - Here I created User Stories using the CI template - AS A - I WANT - SO THAT. 
 - I linked them with my project and moved them into the to do section of my kanban board.
 - I labelled my User Stories in accordance with MoSCow prioritization.  
 - I researched and asked friends and family who had an interest in health what they would want from a health blog site. 
 - I asked them to write some User Stories to see if they came up with ones I hadn't thought of. 
 - I kept my site simple to ensure all the functionality ran smoothly and efficiently, keeping continious attention to technical proficiency. 
 - To start, I chose between one - three 'Must Have' user stories and moved them into the 'in progress' board and continued from there, starting with the 'must have' stories first with some others that over-lapped moving on to the 'should have' and then 'could have' depending on my time frame and scope.

# Scope

The scope of this project was large at the planning stage. The ultimate goal was to allow logged in users to have full CRUD functionality for all their own content. Time constraints meant this was limited to CRUD functionality for logged in users only for their own comments on blog posts as this was deemed a must-have. More functionality for logged in users will be added in the future. For instance, I would like to add the ability for the user to submit a blog post they have written that is then submitted to be approved by the site owner. 

# Structure

The site consists of 6 pages: Home, Sign-up/Sign-in, Blog Posts (x3 currently). All pages can be viewed by all users. The ability to comment/like posts is limited to logged in users. 

# Epics and User Stories
 - I had 8 Epics:

 1. Epic: Set up admin page for admin to manage blog posts, comments and site users. 
 2. Epic: Enable users to set up an account on the site to have full access to features. 
 3. Epic: Create eye-catching home page. 
 4. Epic: Enable registered users to comment/like/edit/delete posts. 
 5. Epic: Create Blog page for users to read blog posts. 
 6. Epic: Enable registered users to interact with blog posts to enhance UX and engagement with other users.
 7. Epic: Enable users to sign-in/register with Facebook account. 
 8. Epic: Enable users to CRUD own comments.  

 - I had 19 User Stories in total and moved them in accordance with whether they were in progress or completed. Here are my User Stories:

           - As a *User*, I want the ability to *comment and delete and edit posts so that manage my own content* (must-have/completed)

 - I labelled them with MoSCow prioritization so that this allowed me to prioritise certain tasks to implement over less important tasks depending on time and scope.
